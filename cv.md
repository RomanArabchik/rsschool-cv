### About me
---
I have 4 years of experience as an engineer in the oil industry. At one moment I decided to change the type of activity because that's not what I want to do. My goal is to start a career as a front-end developer.


### Skills
---
*  HTML5
*  CSS, SCSS (Bootstrap, Material UI)
*  JavaScript
*  ReactJS (hooks), React-Redux (thunk)
*  Git
*  Gulp

### Code Example
---
>Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.
Don't change the order of the elements that are left.
```js
function removeSmallest(numbers) {
  let index = numbers.indexOf(Math.min(...numbers))
  let arr = [...numbers]
  arr.splice(index, 1)
  return arr
}
```
